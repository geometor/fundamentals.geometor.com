Quadrance measures the separation of two points. An easy definition is that quadrance
is distance squared. 

===

Of course this assumes that you already know what distance is. A
point in the decimal number plane can be specified by its x and y coordinates with
respect to a fixed pair of rectangular axes, and the usual definition of the distance
|A1 , A2 | between the points A1 ≡ [x1 , y1 ] and A2 ≡ [x2 , y2 ] is
                                       q
/[
                                                   2               2
| A_1 , A_2 | ≡ /sqrt{(x_2 − x_1 )^2 + (y_2 − y_1 )^2 }
/]

So the quadrance Q (A1 , A2 ) between the points is

                                                 2            2
                         Q (A1 , A2 ) ≡ (x2 − x1 ) +(y2 − y1 ) .


From this point of view, quadrance is the more fundamental quantity, since it does not
involve the square root function. The relationship between the two notions is perhaps
more accurately described by the statement that distance is the square root of
quadrance.

In diagrams, small rectangles along the sides of a triangle indicate that quadrance, not
distance, is being measured, a convention maintained throughout the book.
Occasionally when this is inconvenient, a quadrance is enclosed in a rectangular box.
